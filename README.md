These are assignments and non-school/independent projects related to Artificial Intelligence.

Each project has it's own further explained readme.

### find_route (Python 3)

find_route is a Graph program using Uniform Cost Cost Search and the A* Algorithm to find an optimal route between two cities.

### tic-tac-toe (Python 3)

This is a basic (CLI as of 2021-02-11) tic-tac-toe game. It is currently 1v1 human-vs-human, but I intend to apply state space search strategies and what I learn in my AI course (un/informed algorithms) to make it human-vs-bot as well.
